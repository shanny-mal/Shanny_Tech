              <h2>Become Safe Online</h2>
              <p>Here is a 10 point guideline towards the journey of becoming
                <i><b>safe</b></i> online</p>
            </header>
            <hr />
            <p>
              1. Strong, unique passwords: Develop passwords that are lengthy
              and intricate, containing an assortment of letters, numbers, and
              special characters. Refrain from using common phrases or personal
              information, reducing vulnerability to brute force attacks. A
              password manager can help generate and store these complex
              passwords securely.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Two-factor authentication: Enhance account security by
              requiring two distinct forms of verification. This typically
              involves something you know (like a password) and something you
              have (like a smartphone or authentication token). This
              supplementary layer makes unauthorized access significantly more
              challenging, safeguarding sensitive data.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Update software promptly: Regularly updating your operating
              system, software applications, and security programs is critical.
              Developers release updates to address discovered vulnerabilities
              and enhance system defenses. Failing to update promptly can leave
              your devices exposed to known exploits and malware that can
              exploit outdated code.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Avoid suspicious links: Cybercriminals often use deceptive
              links to lead users to malicious websites or initiate downloads of
              harmful software. Hover over links to preview the URL's
              destination before clicking. Exercise caution when encountering
              links in unsolicited emails, social media messages, or unfamiliar
              websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. Use reputable antivirus: Reliable antivirus software provides
              continuous protection against a spectrum of online threats such as
              viruses, Trojans, and ransomware. Choose well-known, respected
              antivirus solutions that offer real-time scanning, threat
              detection, and regular updates to combat emerging cyber risks
              effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              6. Protect personal info: Safeguarding personal information, like
              Social Security numbers, financial data, and home addresses, is
              paramount. Limit sharing to trusted entities and secure websites.
              Identity theft and fraud often stem from leaked personal
              information, making vigilant protection crucial to online safety.
            </p>
            <p>
              7. Be cautious sharing: Oversharing personal details on social
              media platforms can expose you to various risks, including
              identity theft, stalking, and scams. Cybercriminals may exploit
              shared information to craft convincing phishing attempts or target
              you with tailored attacks. Apply strict privacy settings and think
              twice before divulging personal data.
            </p>
            <p>
              8. Educate against scams: Stay informed about prevalent online
              scams, such as phishing emails, tech support fraud, and investment
              schemes. Educate yourself and others to recognize red flags,
              verify the authenticity of requests, and avoid interactions that
              could compromise financial or personal security.
            </p>
            <p>
              9. Private Wi-Fi usage: Public Wi-Fi networks can be susceptible
              to eavesdropping and data interception. Prioritize secure,
              password-protected networks, and employ a virtual private network
              (VPN) when accessing sensitive information on public connections.
              VPNs encrypt your data, shielding it from potential threats
              lurking on shared networks.
            </p>
            <p>
              10. Regularly back up data: Creating routine backups of your data,
              whether to external hard drives or cloud storage, serves as a
              failsafe against data loss due to hardware malfunctions,
              cyberattacks, or accidental deletion. Regular backups ensure that
              you can restore crucial information and files without succumbing
              to ransomware demands or other disasters.
